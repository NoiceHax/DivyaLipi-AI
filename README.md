### Note on Commit Structure

Due to computational and hardware limitations, particularly GPU availability, all model training, experimentation, and pipeline integration were executed on a single local machine. As a result, all Git operationsâ€”including commits and pushes have been consistently performed from the same device.

This approach ensured:
- Environment consistency across development cycles
- Minimized dependency mismatch or configuration drift
- Direct access to locally stored model artifacts, intermediate results, and debug logs

Future scalability plans include migration to a distributed or cloud-based training pipeline as resources allow.
